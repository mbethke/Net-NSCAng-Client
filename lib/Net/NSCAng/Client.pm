=head1 NAME

Net::NSCAng::Client - Submit host and service monitoring results using the NSCA-ng protocol

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::NSCAng::Client ':rcodes';
  my $c = Net::NSCAng::Client->new('icinga.mydomain.org', 'myid', 's3cr3t',
    node_name => 'server_name',
  );
  $c->svc_result(WARNING, 'BogusService is bogus!', { svc_description => 'bogus' });
    

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Net::NSCAng::Client provides a means of submitting host or service check
results to an L<NSCA-ng|http://www.nsca-ng.org/> server, and to remote-control
your monitoring system using L<external commands|http://docs.icinga.org/latest/en/extcommands2.html>.
It is derived from the Python module written by Alexander Golovko but with a
more perlish interface and additional functionality for sending arbitrary
external commands.

=head2 EXPORT

Nothing by default. The standard Nagios return codes C<OK>, C<WARNING>,
C<CRITICAL>, C<UNKNOWN> and C<DEPENDENT> are available. If you don't use
something like L<Monitoring::Plugin> that exports the same values, use
C<:rcodes> as above to import them. The C<:all> tag is currently synonymous
with C<:rcodes> but might export more things in te future.

=head1 ERROR HANDLING

None of the methods except for L<new>() return anything useful if they
completed successfully.  Errors are signalled by dying with an error message,
so use C<eval>, L<Try::Tiny> or the like.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

  $o = new($host, $identity, $psk, %tags);
  $o = new("icinga.local", "ID", "s3cr3t", node_name => hostname());

The constructor takes three mandatory positional arguments and a number of
optional ones that may be passed as hash-style arguments inline or as a
hashref. The mandatory ones:

=over 4

=item C<$host>: The host name or IP address of the NSCA-ng server

=item C<$identity>: An arbitrary identity string that is used by the server to
find the corrent PSK. You can think of this as the "user name" part of a
regular login.

=item C<$psk>: A pre-shared key configured on the server for C<$identity>.

=back

The following tags are optional:

=over 4

=item C<port>: the TCP port the NSCA-ng server runs on. Defaults to 5668.

=item C<ciphers>: A list of ciphers for OpenSSL to use. See ciphers(1) for
details and don't mess with this unless you know what you're doing. The default
is fine.

=item C<node_name>: The name of the local host as configured in your monitoring
system. This is almost always the host name. You may pass this as an argument
to any of the result methods, but considering that a single host or service
check hardly ever submits results for more than one host, it makes sense to
specify this at construction time and not to worry about it later.

=item C<svc_description>: The service description as configured in your
monitoring system. Same rationale as C<node_name> above.

=item C<timeout>: The timeout in seconds to wait for server responses and
connection setup. Default is 10.

=back

=cut

sub new {
    my ($class, $host, $identity, $psk) = splice(@_, 0, 4);
    my %args = @_%2 ? %{$_[0]} : @_;
    $class->_new($host, $args{port} // 5668, $identity, $psk,
        @args{qw/ ciphers node_name svc_description /},
        $args{timeout} // 10,
    );
}

=head2 svc_result

  svc_result($return_code, $plugin_output, %tags);
  svc_result(WARNING, "Warning: foo is purple!");

Submit a service check result. C<$return_code> is a Nagios-style plugin return
code between 0 and 4, and C<$plugin_output> is a human-readable description.
The optional arguments may be passed hash-style inline or as a hashref just
like for the constructor. The supported keys are C<node_name> and
C<svc_description>, see L</new()> for their use. If specified here, the values
override anything that may have been set in the constructor. If you haven't set
them in the constructor, you MUST set them here though!

=cut

sub svc_result {
    my ($self, $return_code, $plugin_output) = splice(@_, 0, 3);
    my %args = @_%2 ? %{$_[0]} : @_;
    my $err = $self->_result(0,
        @args{qw/ node_name svc_description /}, $return_code, $plugin_output
    );
    $err and croak("svc_result: $err");
}

=head2 host_result

  host_result($return_code, $plugin_output, %tags);
  host_result(OK, "Everything is peachy");

Submit a host check result. This is the same as L</svc_result()>, the only
exception being that the C<svc_description> argument obviously makes no sense
for a host check and is thus not supported. If an C<svc_description> should
have been set in the constructor, it is ignored for this call.

=cut

sub host_result {
    my ($self, $return_code, $plugin_output) = splice(@_, 0, 3);
    my %args = @_%2 ? %{$_[0]} : @_;
    my $err = $self->_result(1, $args{node_name}, '', $return_code, $plugin_output);
    $err and croak("host_result: $err");
}

=head2 command

  command($cmd);
  command(
    sprintf("SCHEDULE_HOST_DOWNTIME;myserver;%d;%d;1;0;0;root;Hooray for NSCA-ng!",
        0+time, 3600+time
    )
  );

Submit an arbitrary command to your monitoring host. Commands have to be
prefixed by a timestamp in seconds since the Unix epoch enclosed in angle
brackets to be accepted by the server; if you leave this off, the method will
add it for you. Refer to the Nagios/Icinga documentiation for available
commands and the format to follow for each command.

=head1 BUGS

=over 4

=item This module is not thread safe! Due do a workaround for the godawful OpenSSL
API, static data has to be used, and this I<will> cause problems with threads.
The original Python library uses pthreads to get around that but due to Perl's
different threading model this would probably not work. Using the C<MY_CXT>
macros is a possibility but frankly I'm too lazy to try just for supporting
Perl threads that don't work well in the first place.

=item I have enabled extra compiler warnings for gcc. This may break things on
other compilers and will unfortunately also spew a lot of warnings within Perl
header files.
